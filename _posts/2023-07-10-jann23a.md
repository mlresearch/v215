title: Testing the coherence of data and external intervals via an imprecise Sargan-Hansen
  test
abstract: When information about a population is sparse, it is difficult to test whether
  a data set originated from that population. In applied research, however, researchers
  often have access to external information in the form of (central) statistical moments
  such as mean or variance. To compensate for the uncertainty in the external point
  values, this paper uses external intervals instead to represent the information
  about moments. The Sargan-Hansen test from the generalized method of moments framework
  is used, which exploits point-valued external information about moments in the presence
  of a statistical model to test whether data and external information are in conflict.
  For the Sargan-Hansen test, a separability result is derived with respect to the
  model and the external information. This result leads to a simplification of the
  test in terms of its analytical form and the calculation of the test statistics.
  To allow the use of external intervals instead of point values, an imprecise version
  of the Sargan-Hansen test is created using the Gamma-maximin decision rule. Assuming
  that the variables are normally distributed, a small sample version of this imprecise
  Sargan-Hansen test is derived. The power and type I errors of the developed tests
  are analyzed and compared in a simulation study in different small sample scenarios.
