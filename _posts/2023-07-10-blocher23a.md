title: Depth functions for partial orders with a descriptive analysis of machine learning
  algorithms
abstract: We propose a framework for descriptively analyzing sets of partial orders
  based on the concept of depth functions. Despite intensive studies of depth functions
  in linear and metric spaces, there is very little discussion on depth functions
  for non-standard data types such as partial orders. We introduce an adaptation of
  the well-known simplicial depth to the set of all partial orders, the union-free
  generic (ufg) depth. Moreover, we utilize our ufg depth for a comparison of machine
  learning algorithms based on multidimensional performance measures. Concretely,
  we analyze the distribution of different classifier performances over a sample of
  standard benchmark data sets. Our results promisingly demonstrate that our approach
  differs substantially from existing benchmarking approaches and, therefore, adds
  a new perspective to the vivid debate on the comparison of classifiers.
