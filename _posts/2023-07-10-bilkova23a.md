title: Describing and quantifying contradiction between pieces of evidence via Belnap
  Dunn logic and Dempster-Shafer theory
abstract: Belnap Dunn logic is a four-valued logic introduced to model reasoning with
  incomplete or contradictory information. In this article, we show how Dempster-Shafer
  theory can be used over Belnap Dunn logic in order to formalise reasoning with incomplete
  and/or contradictory pieces of evidence. First, we discuss how to encode different
  kinds of evidence, and how to interpret the resulting belief and plausibility functions.
  Then, we discuss the behaviour of Dempster’s rule in this framework and present
  a variation of the rule. Finally, we show how to construct credal sets of classical
  probability measures based on this kind of evidence.
