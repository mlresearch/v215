title: 'Differential privacy: general inferential limits via intervals of measures'
abstract: 'Differential privacy (DP) is a mathematical standard for assessing the
  privacy provided by a data-release mechanism. We provide formulations of pure $\epsilon$-differential
  privacy first as a Lipschitz continuity condition and then using an object from
  the imprecise probability literature: the interval of measures. We utilise this
  second formulation to establish bounds on the appropriate likelihood function for
  $\epsilon$-DP data – and in turn derive limits on key quantities in both frequentist
  hypothesis testing and Bayesian inference. Under very mild conditions, these results
  are valid for arbitrary parameters, priors and data generating models. These bounds
  are weaker than those attainable when analysing specific data generating models
  or data-release mechanisms. However, they provide generally applicable limits on
  the ability to learn from differentially private data – even when the analyst’s
  knowledge of the model or mechanism is limited. They also shed light on the semantic
  interpretation of differential privacy, a subject of contention in the current literature.'
