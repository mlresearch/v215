title: 'In all likelihoods: robust selection of pseudo-labeled data'
abstract: 'Self-training is a simple yet effective method within semi-supervised learning.
  Self-trainingâ€™s rationale is to iteratively enhance training data by adding pseudo-labeled
  data. Its generalization performance heavily depends on the selection of these pseudo-labeled
  data (PLS). In this paper, we render PLS more robust towards the involved modeling
  assumptions. To this end, we treat PLS as a decision problem, which allows us to
  introduce a generalized utility function. The idea is to select pseudo-labeled data
  that maximize a multi-objective utility function. We demonstrate that the latter
  can be constructed to account for different sources of uncertainty and explore three
  examples: model selection, accumulation of errors and covariate shift. In the absence
  of second-order information on such uncertainties, we furthermore consider the generic
  approach of the generalized Bayesian $\alpha$-cut updating rule for credal sets.
  We spotlight the application of three of our robust extensions on both simulated
  and three real-world data sets. In a benchmarking study, we compare these extensions
  to traditional PLS methods. Results suggest that robustness with regard to model
  choice can lead to substantial accuracy gains.'
